    <h2 class="fancy">Jokes created by Jayant</h2>
    <p>My 9 year old son Jayant, likes to tell jokes a lot. More than telling jokes, he likes to create jokes. And believe me, his jokes are really funny for a 9 year old. I have been promising him that I will document them and publish them on my website and a book. So here I am doing the first part.</p>
    <ul class="invisible"><p>Once the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</a> invited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a> over for dinner. The Sun ate heartily and gorged himself, but the Moon only took one serving. Why?</p>
    <p>Answer: She was a full moon.</p>
