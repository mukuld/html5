# HTML5

GWG
I had created this repository is to hold my code that I created as a part of Grow with Google Front end web development nano degree program.  
Since then, I have tried to do some work on HTML5 and build my site and portfolio of HTML5 in order to have a moonlighting career.  

I will keep adding new stuff here as I explore HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to fork this.
