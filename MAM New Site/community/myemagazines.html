<h2 class="underline">My e-Magazines - Your source for Marathi Literature online</h2>


The good folks at <a href="http://www.myemagazines.com">My e-Magazines</a> are working diligently to spread the magic of Marathi magazines among a greater readership, which will ensure their presence in the market for future generations. As of now, many good Marathi magazines have discontinued publication due to a lack of readership and finance, because today’s generation demands more English periodicals. Consequently, many good writers have ceased to submit their work due to a lack of career assurance and therefore have become unmotivated.<p>

Please visit the website, <a href="http://www.myemagazines.com">www.myemagazines.com</a>, and click on "Prashansa" to know that Marathi newspapers and other media are voicing this same opinion.<p>

Please help in spreading the word among your mandal members or you may forward the link to this page to them for their information.<p>

Please visit the <a href="http://www.myemagazines.com">My e-Magazines</a> website to learn more about the activities.<p>

Currently, there are 27 monthly magazines and 50 Diwali Ank to read online. Few more are in pipeline.<p>

Please share this information with your friends and relatives, who love reading Marathi. We are sure they will be thankful to you for informing them about this.<p>

We highly appreciate your help in this regard!
